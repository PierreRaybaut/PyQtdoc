# PyQtdoc

PyQtdoc installs Qt documentation for PyQt (.ch files, i.e. Qt assistant format) in a dedicated directory.

PyQtdoc version is indexed to Qt version.

PyQtdoc is part of the WinPython distribution project.

Important note
--------------

    Since Qt5, ``QtAssistant`` cannot register documentation automatically.
    You must run the ``scripts\pyqtdoc.py`` script (with option `--register`) or register them manually.
